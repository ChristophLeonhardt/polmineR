v0.4.16
 * inclusion of sample Data

v0.4.15
 * reduction of dependencies for publication of the package on CRAN

v0.4.14
 * adapting partition and distribution functions to cope with nested xml
 
v0.4.13

 * usability of concordances improved

v0.4.12
 * partitionMerge changed so that it will use full functionality of partition-function
 * helper functions for distribution on two dimensions improved, tremendous gain in speed
 * started to fill in sample code into vignette

v0.4.12

v0.4.11
 * inclusion of shiny apps
 * function 'distribution' as wrapper for functions to inspect distribution

v0.4.10
 * improved usability of the package, started to use lowerCamelCase

v0.4.9
 * partition can now be called without explicitly stating a label
 * partition does not require sAttributes to be set, function .sattributes2cpos streamlined
 * no labels in partition.cluster
 * in context, the pos.filter can also be set as an exclusion   

v0.4.8
 * started to make functions more usable by shortening function names, 'partition.init' is now 'partition'
 * xterm highlighting for collocates
 * context can be called with parameters given by drillingControls

v0.4.7
 * xtermStyle used for kwic output on console
 * partition object can be indexed

v0.4.6
 * partition.init expanded to allow for the generation of partitions with specified start and end dates

v0.4.4
 * combine.collocates improved (new columns for plotting)

v0.4.3
 * bug-fix for partition.merge

v0.4.1
 *  partition.init can be used without setting up frequency lists and metadata. This may be useful, if a quick partition.init is desired and term frequencies and/or metadata are not needed.
 *  partition.init can handle sattribute-lists with length == 1. partition.init will still not work, if no sattributes are given.
 *  query.crosstab has been renamed to crosstab
 *  crosstab will accept special characters (transforming them to .)
